## WG* Rent Calculator

This is a small program that takes in the data of your apartment in json format and outputs a markdown file with a table that outlines the costs of rent for each individual roommate in detail.

To use it, simply change the data in `data.json` and run `calc.py`.

To save the markdown file as a pdf, you can download the extension *Markdown PDF* by yzane for Visual Studio Code and export it to pdf. 

###### \*WG is the German abbreviated word for shared living space.
